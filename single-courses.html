                        <p>Hello and welcome to FundsIndia Academy! In this course, we’ll learn about Financial Goals. This course has three parts: Your Financial Personality – we’ll learn about you. What kind of financial person are you? Cautious? Clueless? Experienced? Everyone has a unique style.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="video_timeline_desc">
                        <span>0:30</span>
                        <p>Your investment decisions should be compatible with your financial self. Smart Financial Goals – Everyone has different goals. In the second unit, we’ll help you clarify your goals. Finally, in Target Sum, the third mini-unit, we’ll help you calculate how much you should be saving in order to reach your goals. Remember, you can pause or rewind at any time. If you want to take a break, just note down roughly where you are in the course</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="video_timeline_desc">
                        <span>1:00</span>
                        <p>And you can fast-forward back to that spot the next time you log in. Are you ready? Let’s begin. Unit 1: Your Financial Personality In this unit, you will explore: Your money personality and Where you are now financially But don’t worry! We’re not going to ask you to calculate exactly how many paisa you have under the mattress. We’re going to show you some examples, and let you choose which one seems to fit you the best</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="video_timeline_desc">
                        <span>1:30</span>
                        <p>Given a choice wouldn't you want to earn as much as Warren Buffett or be as wealthy as Mukesh Ambani? Okay, if not that much, at least 1/1000th of these? Each person has to follow their own road to riches It is an axiom of life that it’s your ATTITUDE that decides your ALTITUDE. It therefore pays to know what kind of attitude you have towards money.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="video_timeline_desc">
                        <span>2:00</span>
                        <p>Let’s discover your money personality! In a minute, you’re going to see nine statements about risk. Your job is to note down the number of the statement that best describes how you feel about financial risk. In other words, which statement is MOST like you? There are no right or wrong answers, just, a chance to learn more about yourself. If you have a doubt on your choice, remember that your first thought is probably your best thought</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="video_timeline_desc">
                        <span>2:30</span>
                        <p>Pause here if you want to find a piece of scratch paper to write down the number of the statement that best fits your money personality. OK, let’s begin. The most important thing to do with money is to keep it safe. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush. Risk taking often worries me. I am generally conservative when dealing with risk</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="video_timeline_desc">
                        <span>3:00</span>
                        <p>Sometimes I take risk; sometimes I play safe. I am generally aggressive when dealing with risk. Sometimes I take risk on impulse. I take big risk but I choose them carefully. I’m open to take a lot of risk for the chance of a big gain</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="video_timeline_desc">
                        <span>3:30</span>
                        <p>That’s it! If you have made your pick, that’s great. If you’re not sure, click rewind and go back through the nine statements again. One minute! Your money personality is not just about risk. It’s also about spending. Note the number from the first quiz. We’re going to take another quick quiz together. It works exactly the same way as the first one. You’ll see nine statements.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="video_timeline_desc">
                        <span>4:00</span>
                        <p>Note down the number of the statement that best describes how you feel about spending. In other words, which statement is MOST like you? I squeeze every Rupee that I can out of my budget. Whatever I have, I always spend less. I’m a very careful shopper and I always look for discounts. I buy quality and rely on brand names.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="video_timeline_desc">
                        <span>4:30</span>
                        <p>If I can save 10% of my income, I’m happy. I like to pamper myself with little things. I love to splurge once in a while. My credo is: Life is short. Eat dessert first. I happily spend every Rupee I get</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="video_timeline_desc">
                        <span>5:00</span>
                        <p>OK, that’s really it – no more quizzes for the time being! You should now have two numbers – a spending number and a risk number. If you’re not sure which statements best describe you, rewind and go back through the two quizzes again. This graph is a tool for understanding your money personality. Each area represents a financial type, identified by your risk number and your spending number.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="video_timeline_desc">
                        <span>5:30</span>
                        <p>Don’t worry if you identify yourself with more than one personality type - these are not watertight compartments. It works like this: find the point on the horizontal Spending axis corresponding to your spending number. I chose “8. My credo is: Life is short. Eat dessert first” Then find the point on the vertical Risk axis corresponding to your risk number. I chose “2. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush”</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="video_timeline_desc">
                        <span>6:00</span>
                        <p>From each point, draw a perpendicular line towards the middle of the graph. The place where they meet is your money personality type. My personality type is “Life of the Party” If your lines meet on a boundary, you decide which type best represents you. Don’t worry if you’re not happy with your type. It’s situational, and people move from one type to another over time. The objective here is to simply help you understand your financial personality better.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="video_timeline_desc">
                        <span>6:30</span>
                        <p>Have you found your type? Let’s see what each type is like. Sturdy Accumulator: You love to accumulate wealth. You save a lot. Several very successful businessmen display this trait. You can be whimsical and don't like “No” for an answer. You hate taxes. You put most of your money in one or two investment baskets and have oodles of faith in yourself</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="video_timeline_desc">
                        <span>7:00</span>
                        <p>The Speculator: You spend your way to wealth, risking much to earn even more. An incorrigible optimist, you believe in leverage, that is, borrowing money to maximize your own returns. You like to bet against the herd. You hate recordkeeping and are vulnerable to get-rich quick schemes. Sometimes your bets don’t turn out as well as you hope, and the money you’ve spent is gone</p>

                        <p>Champion Saver: You are a natural saver. You learn quickly and love recordkeeping. Your greatest fear is that you might ‘lose it all’ and hence you search for very safe investments. This means that you sometimes miss out on high returns</p>

                        <p>Life of the Party: You’re friendly and always willing to try new things. You don’t take money too seriously and you always try to help out the financially needy. You can be a bit of a spendthrift, confusing wants with needs. Your friendly nature means that you can be overgenerous, and end up regretting your spending. The good news is that when you pay attention to your habits, you make rapid financial progress.</p>

                        <p>Entrepreneur: You don't mind taking risks; and you believe in what you are doing. You have a knack for seeing the big picture. Generally you invest in your area of expertise. For you, your work is your life. Everything else is secondary. Your net-worth is your scorecard, but don’t rush to judge people by how much money they have made. The Builder: You are a builder, whether it’s building a career or building a nest egg. Your favorite investment is your work. You are family oriented, practical, and you plan for retirement.</p>

                        <p>You can sometimes bye overconfident about handling money. “Smart” moves can backfire, for example, paying off a loan in advance and then finding yourself constrained for cash later. High savings and a willingness to take on risk make you an attractive target for marketers.</p>

                        <p>Worker Bee: You work long hours; and you make a lot of money. You are by nature slightly conservative, avoiding schemes and scams. Since you don’t have much time for things other than work, you probably spend money on time saving gadgets. You often just go for the fancy brand rather than research the best deal. Globe Trotter: You are the type that spends money on experiences. You don't care much about money. That doesn't mean you don't like money. It is just that you’re relaxed about spending it. Your high spending makes it hard to build a nest egg. When you cut back, it can feel like a big sacrifice, when in fact it is your spending that might sacrifice a comfortable retirement!</p>

                        <p>In the next section, we’re going to look at a different aspect of your financial life: Your career and financial track How many years have you been working? How much do you have to show for it? You should set a target for each stage of your career Let’s look at five examples of people at different stages of their careers. You can then compare your assets and goals with theirs, get a feel for how you are doing, and, get some ideas of things you should consider doing</p>

                        <p>Ready? Let’s begin Meet Yuvraj. He’s a Young Professional. He graduated a little over 3 years ago. He now works in a large air-conditioned office in a fast growing suburb of a major metro He’s still in touch with his college batch mates, who, like him, are now lawyers, doctors, techies, engineers, chartered accountants, and management trainees</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="video_timeline_desc">
                        <span>11:30</span>
                        <p>Yuvraj is single and earning well for a recent graduate. He has no great financial commitments, but somehow doesn’t have much left over at the end of the month. He’s heard people talk about saving and investment. It sounds like a good idea, but he’s not sure how; His family used to take care of money matters Yuvraj has a nice laptop, a new phone, and a fancy 2-wheeler. He wishes he could afford to upgrade to a 4-wheeler</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="video_timeline_desc">
                        <span>12:00</span>
                        <p>Poor Yuvi. After 4 years of working, and an annual salary of 3.6 lakhs, he’s only got about Rs. 30,000 in the bank. His net assets of 1 lakh, including his bike and his laptop, are much less than he should expect. A good target for young professionals is to multiply their annual income by a factor of 1/2 to 1, which means Yuvraj should have roughly 2 to 4 lakhs by now. If he had saved 5% of his income over his career, he would have!</p>

                    <div class="video_timeline_desc">
                        <span>12:30</span>
                        <p>Meet Lena. She’s an “Emerging Leader” She has been in work for about 6-7 years. She recently got married and is thinking about kids. Now, with a double income and no dependents, she and her husband are earning well. Lena is basically levelheaded and does her homework. She is motivated to invest but lacks experience.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="video_timeline_desc">
                        <span>13:00</span>
                        <p>She has almost paid off the EMI on her 4-wheeler, and is starting to think about a foreign holiday, or, more importantly, buying a small flat instead of renting. Other than the car payment, she has no debt. Lena earns 6.6 lakhs per year. She has 1 lakh in her savings account and another 1 lakh in a fixed deposit. Combined with the value of her jewelry, car, and household appliances, she has 6 lakhs in assets, which is a little below where she should be</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="video_timeline_desc">
                        <span>13:30</span>
                        <p>A good target for emerging leaders is to multiply their annual income by a factor of 1 or 2. Hmmm…maybe she should have put some of her money to work instead of leaving it stuck in a post office account these past few years Meet Mani. He’s a “Mid-Career Professional” He is 35, married, with 2 young kids. He and his wife live in a new flat that they are paying off with a big EMI.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="video_timeline_desc">
                        <span>14:00</span>
                        <p>His whole pay cheque seems to disappear into the kids and the mortgage. Mani’s EMI might be crushing, but he did well to purchase a flat when prices were lower Combined with the money he put into mutual funds before the kids came along, he’s right on target, with about 40 lakhs in net assets. A good target for mid-career professionals is to multiply their annual income by a factor of 2 to 4.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="video_timeline_desc">
                        <span>14:30</span>
                        <p>Mani is doing well, but he should revisit his monthly budget now that his second child is about to start school! Meet Sarath. He’s a “Seasoned Professional” He’s been working and investing for a long time, shifting houses, bank accounts, mutual funds, jobs, and even languages! Sarath would like to retire early, but he expects to spend on his daughter’s wedding and his son’s education!</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="video_timeline_desc">
                        <span>15:00</span>
                        <p>He earns Rs 1.8 lakhs per month, but still feels pressed for cash as he saves for a marriage, engineering college, and his retirement. Still, 1.3 crores is a LOT of money. A good target for seasoned professionals is to multiply their annual income by 4 to 6. Sarath has hit his target through a career of careful investing in real estate, gold, and mutual funds. His biggest asset is his house. He may want to think about rebalancing his portfolio.</p>

                        <p>Meet Asif. He’s getting ready to start his “Active Second Innings” Asif has saved and invested for a lifetime and hopes to soon enjoy retirement in comfort. When he retires, he’ll have to move out of company quarters. He is worried that a long retirement will leave him dependent on his children, who are not keen on living joint-family.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="video_timeline_desc">
                        <span>16:00</span>
                        <p>Asif currently earns Rs. 2 lakhs a month, but he knows that will change after he retires. He is definitely a crorepati. He came late to investing, but since his children graduated he has been investing Rs 40,000 per month. As you get closer to retirement, your asset target goes up. Asif should multiply his annual income by 6 to 8. He’s comfortably on target, but he should think about adjusting his portfolio, because he’ll soon have only irregular outside income. He should also draw up a will.</p>

                        <p>Do any of these five avatars sound similar to you? How do your income and net assets compare to Yuvraj Lena Mani Sarath Or Asif? While each avatar is a specific example, you’ve probably heard or felt some variation of what they are going through, whether it’s upgrading to a 4-wheeler, buying your first flat Finding money for school fees, Saving for an alliance</p>
